***Lorelei Labs*** is a group of volunteer developers who are focused on developing AI software that is sustainable, scalable, and most importantly, truly open for everyone.

We are most well known for our efforts in developing open source dialogue and story telling language models, but we do our own research and development towards the sustainable hosting of these gigantic AI models.
